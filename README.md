# Gaming-Blog
NextJS news site with Strapi CMS centered around gaming. 

## Summary
For this project I wanted to learn how to work with a headless CMS, such as Strapi.
                      The purpose of the website was to function as a pseudo gaming news site. 
                        Admins will be able to register outside users as Editors and Writers for the site. Writers 
                        will able to write articles and add imagesm with the Strapi text editor. 
                        Editors and Admins will then be able to edit the cotent written by writers and choose if and when 
                        to publish. Fetching of data from Strapi to the React client is faciltated by GraphQl queries.
